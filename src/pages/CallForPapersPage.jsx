            About the Conference: (ICCMS-2025) <br />
          </span>{' '}
          The Department of Civil Engineering at Srinivasa Ramanujan Institute of Technology (Autonomous), Ananthapuramu, is proud to host a National Conference under the AICTE â€“ VAANI (Vibrant Advocacy for Advancement and Nurturing of Indian Languages) Scheme, titled:
        </p>
        <h4 class ="dialog">Next Generation Construction with Sustainable, Resilient, and Smart Civil Engineering" (NCSRSCâ€“2025)</h4> <br />
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>ðŸ“… September 18â€“19, 2025 <br />
This bilingual conference (Telugu & English) aims to foster the creation and dissemination of technical knowledge in regional languages, particularly Telugu, thereby enhancing accessibility and inclusiveness in technical education. It aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) and the Viksit Bharat 2047 vision of creating a self-reliant, knowledge-driven India.
The event will serve as a platform for academicians, researchers, industry professionals, and students to exchange innovative ideas, explore emerging materials and technologies in civil engineering, and contribute to the creation of a sustainable built environment. Special emphasis will be placed on climate-resilient infrastructure, eco-friendly construction practices, and industry-academia collaboration through technical sessions, discussions, and presentations.
As a core outcome, the conference will encourage publication of research papers in Telugu and English, and release <b>ISBN-certified bilingual proceedings.</b>
